# Audio-Oscillator
This header file implements a Bandlimited Impulse Train (BLIT) Oscillator, a key component in high-quality digital synthesis. Unlike naive oscillators that suffer from aliasing, this BLIT-based approach efficiently generates bandlimited waveforms suitable for professional audio applications.
